- Many ways to represent event based data.
	- Individual events
		- Good for processing with SNNs.
	- Points set
		- 3D - point set with space-time information.
		- 2D - Evolving point set on image plane to give the shape of the image.
		- May introduces latency and might discard polarity.
	- Event frames/2D point set
		- Histogram
			- Pixelwise counting of events
		- Motion compensated event frames
		- Time surface - seperately discussed
		- Event selection for frames:
			- Sliding window
				- Events at constant time intervals
				- Constant number of events
				- Adaptive area-event-number
			- Merits:
				- Compatible with conventional computer vision algorithms
					- Intuitive and informative interpretation as they look like edge maps.
					- Edges contain a lot of information of the scene.
					- Frames from events could be asynchronous and with HDR.
			- De-merits
				- Not the event based paradigm
				- Quantizes the event timestamps
				- Power utilization for creating frames
				- Latency is introduced
				- No. of event to use? Requires tuning.
		- Brightness Increment Images
			- Obtained by accumulating event polarities.
			- Polarity is used
			- Intuitive interpretation
			- Use cases:
				- Stereo depth estimation
				- Camera pose estimation
				- Optical flow estimation
				- Grayscale frame prediction, etc.
		- Time surfaces
			- A time map image.
			- Every pixel value in the function of time value of the last event at that pixel.
			- Also called motion-history images.
			- It tells that how far-away in the past, the event happened.
			- Advantages:
				- Rich temporal information
				- Intensity is a function of motion
				- Can be robust to noise using local filtering
				- Asynchronous update with every event
				- Conventional CV compatible
			- Demerits
				- Expensive
				- Only one value per pixel
				- Not good for textured scenes
					- More pixel overwrite
	- Voxel grid
		- 3D histogram of events
		- Discretized space-time representation
		- Voting (Insertion) mechanism:
			- Nearest neighbor
				- Each votes for one cell only
			- Linear
				- Each event splits its vote according to distance to neighboring voxels.
				- Produces smoother histogram
		- Advantages
			- Better space-time structure preservance than 2D
			- Compatible with conventional CV-DL algorithms.
		- Disadvantages
			- A lot of memory
			- Time is still quantized
	- Motion-Compensated event frames
	- Reconstructed intensity images
