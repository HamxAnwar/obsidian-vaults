- Computer vision is very important in various fields of AI and robotics.
- Challenges for current sensors:
	- Latency
	- Motion blur
	- Dynamic range
- Another sensor comes to rescue. #Dynamic_Vision_Sensor
- Works with a DVS:
	- RoboGolie (2007)
	- Pencil balancer (2009)
	- High speed 3D scanner (2015)
		- Better results than kinect.
	- Tightly coupled sensor fusion -UltimateSLAM (2018)
- DVS are:
	- Very reactive
	- low latency
	- high speeds.
	- High dynamic range
	- Low power
	- High efficiency
- Event based vision is growing exponentially.
