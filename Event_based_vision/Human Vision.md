- To understand the working of human vision, we can say that visual information generated by the eyes and goes through optical nerve to brain.
- It gets transmitted to two pathways.
	- Dorsal (Transient) visual pathway
		- Answers where.
		- Mimics the magno cells
		- It perceives motion
		- These are present all over the retina.
		- Fast processing
		- Event cameras mimic these.
	- Ventral (Sustained) visual pathway
		- Answers what.
		- Mimics the parvo cells
		- Processes details in the scene.
		- More detailed
		- Slow processing
		- Standard cameras mimic these.
