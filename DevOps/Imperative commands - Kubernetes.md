- ```kubectl get nodes```
- ```kubectl get pods -A```
	- Outputs all the pods inside the cluster.
	- Give all the components of the cluster such as apiServer, networking related stuff, etc.
- ```kubectl get pods -A -owide```
	- Gives all the components with the nodes where they are running.
	- We can see that the controller manager, API-server, etcd, all run on the control plane.
- ```kubectl run <pod name> --image=<image name>```
- When we run a pod, we can get a YAML file through dry run.
	- ```kubectl run <pod name> --image=<iamge name> --dry-runclient -oyaml```
- ```kubectl api-resources```
	- Give the list of all the APIs.
- #Namespaces
	- For multiple teams, if the dev team is using an image while the testing team changes the image for some testing purpose, it will create issues.
	- Thus we create namespaces.
	- We can create same pod names in different namespaces.
	- Dev and test teams can run the same images in their own respective namespaces without conflicting.
	- To create namespaces:
		- ```kubectl create ns <namespace>```
	- We can also deploy pods in a certain namespace such as:
		- ```kubectl create deploy <pod name> --image=<image name> -n <namespace>```
	- To get the namespaces, we can use:
		- ```kubectl get ns```
	- There are four namespaces in kubernetes.
		- default
			- This namespace contains the user applications.
			- kubectl get pod
		- kube-node-lease
			- Contains the heartbeat of the nodes.
			- Every node has lease objects.
			- ```kubectl get lease -n kube-node-lease```
			- Each node will have a lease
		- kube-public
			- kube-public contains the cluster info and certificate data.
			- ```kubectl get cm -n kube-public```
		- kube-system
			- Runs all the system pods.
			- Reserved for the system.
			- We should not run our pod here.
	- In a single namespace, to see what pods are running, we use:
		- ```kubectl get pods -n <namespace>```
	- To get the description of namespaces:
		- ```kubectl describe ns <namespace>```
		- We can also do it in declarative format.
			- ```kubectl create ns demo --dry-run=client -oyaml```
	- Deleting namespace:
		- ```kubectl delete ns <namespace>```
	- Switching context
		- ```kubectl get pods``` only show the pods in default ns.
		- To switch context, we do:
			- ```kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>```
			- Now the ```kubectl get pods``` will show the pods in <namespace>.
