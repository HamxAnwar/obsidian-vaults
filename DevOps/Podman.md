- Containerization platform from RedHat enterprise.
	- Alternative to docker.

	- Could be secure than docker.
		- Daemon-less container engine.
			- Docker uses an architecture with daemon.
			- Docker uses some background process (docker daemon) to listen to the instructions provided by the user.
			- Podman directly establishes communication between the CRI and the infrastructure.
		- Rootless architecture
			- Docker containers as well as the daemon runs as a root process.
			- Podman containers are not always root.
				- Can be as root or rootless mode.
				- It doesn't mean the user of the container to be root or rootless but every container that we spin with docker, it uses a root process to run it even if we run it as a simple user in group docker.
				- This is because docker daemon is a root process.
- Lets start with [[Pods with Podman]]
