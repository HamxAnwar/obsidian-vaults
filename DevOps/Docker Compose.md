- To run a container, we can:
	- ```docker run --name <container name> -itd -p 80:80 <image name>```
- We can do the same using docker compose.
	- It can run not only one container but multiple containers with a single file and terminal commands.
	- In other words, we can say that writing the above command in a  file can be called docker compose.
	- We make a folder dedicated to a single docker-compose file.
	- Try to keep the name docker-compose.yaml since it is the default that docker looks out for.
	- We can specify build parameter in the compose file instead of the image to build our own dockerfile.
	- A basic docker compose file for nginx with default networking is as follows:
		![[docker-compose.yaml]]
		- ```docker compose up -d```
		- ```docker compose down```
		- ```docker compose stop```
		- ```docker compose start```
	- We can also create networks for our containers.
		- An updated file containing two containers and a network is attached below.
		![[docker-compose 1.yaml]]
		- ```docker network ls```
		- ```docker network inspect <network name>```
	- When we update the file, it only updates the file and create the new things instead of recreating the whole thing.
- Next we will go with deploying [[Wordpress with docker compose]]
