	- On-demand delivery vs cloud deployments.
	- [[Pay-as-you-go pricing model]]
- So what is a cloud compute model?
	- All modern computing centers around a client-server model.
		- A client can be a web browser or a desktop application.
		- A client makes a request.
		- A server response to that request.
		- In the world of computing, a request could be anything from analyzing weather to images to machine learning model training/deployment or as simple as asking for the score in an online game, or a funny video.
		- In AWS, the server is referred as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( #Amazon-EC2 )
		- The process may have three basic steps:
			- Request from client.
			- Validation (if the request is originated from an authentic source or if the request is fine).
			- Response from server.
		- So what is cloud computing?
			- It is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, etc.) over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
		- Deployment model for cloud computing
			- A company must consider:
				- required application components
				- resource management tools
				- legacy IT infrastructure requirements
			- Three deployment models for cloud computing:
				- Cloud based
				- On-premises
				- Hybrid
			- Benefits of cloud computing:
				- Trade upfront expenses for variable expense.
				- No spending money in data centers.
				- No guessing capacity. Increase on the go.
				- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
				- Flexibility.
				- Go global for customer's anywhere.
