- Starting with Nmap and the first question...
	- Who is online?
- Nmap uses different techniques to specify the network / host.
	- `-`: Give IP range such as `192.168.16.10-50`
	- `/`: Give subnet such as `192.168.16.1/24`
	- Can give the hostname directly such as `example.thm`
- Always start nmap with root or sudo.
- We can scan the complete IP network such as 192.168.16.0
- For local networks, Nmap uses ICMP requests and ARP requests.
- For directly connected networks, Nmap uses ARP request.
- For remote networks (a network where we have atleast one router between the two networks), we cannot use ARP requests. So what does it use?
	- While nmaping a remote network, we see:
		- `192.168.11.1` is live and responded to the ICMP echo (ping) request.
		- `192.168.11.2` seems down.
			- Nmap sent:
				- two ICMP echo (ping) requests
				- two ICMP timestamp requests
				- two TCP packets to port 443 with the SYN flag set
				- two TCP packets to port 80 with the ACK flag set.
				- The target didnâ€™t respond to any.
- Arguments:
	- `-sn`: Ping scan. For local networks, it gives MAC addresses too. (default if no argument is provided)
	- `-PS[portlist]`: TCP Syn discovery via given ports.
	- `-PA[portlist]`: TCP Ack discovery via given ports.
	- `-PU[portlist]`: UDP discovery via given ports.
	- `-sL`: List scan. This scan only lists the targets to scan without actually scanning them.
		- Helps confirm targets before actually scanning them.
- Though `-sn` only scans the live hosts by pinging what services are running, it doesn't give back the services. That makes it very quiet scan.
	- To know what services are running on a host, we need a more noisy type of scan.
