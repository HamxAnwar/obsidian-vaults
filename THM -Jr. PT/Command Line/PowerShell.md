- Commands of a powershell are known as cmdlets or commandlets.
- Follows a consistent verb-noun convention.
	- Verb : action.
	- Noun : Object on which the action is to be performed.
	- **Get-Content**: Retrieves (gets) the content of a file and displays it in the console.
	- **Set-Location**: Changes (sets) the current working directory.
	- **Get-Command**: Gets the commands and scripts that can be executed.
	- Based on the command type, we can filter out the commands as:
		`Get-Command -CommandType "Function"`
	- **Get-Help**: Equivalent to `man` command in linux terminal.
	- **Get-Alias**: Gets the aliases for many of the commands known for the cmd.
		- `dir` = `Get-ChildItem`
		- `cd` = `Set-Location`
	- We can add additional cmdlets from various online repositories.
		- We can find additional repositories using `Find-Module`
		- Not knowing the exact name, we can use wildcards with a partial name such as:
				`Cmdlet -Property "pattern*"`
				`Find-Module -Name "PowerShell*"`
		- After we know the name of the module:
				`Install-Module -Name "PowerShellGet"`
	- `Get-ChildItem -Path "Path_to_file/folder"`
	- `Set-Location -Path "Path_to_file/folder"`
	- `New-Item -Path "Path_to_file/folder" -ItemType "File/Directory"`
	- `Remove-Item -Path "Path_to_file/folder"`
	- `Copy-Item -Path "Path_to_file/folder"`
	- `Get-Content -Path "Path_to_file.txt"`
- Piping, Filtering and Sorting Data
	- Piping is a technique used to provide the output of one command to the input of another command.
	- Shown by `|`
	- In PS, piping passes objects rather than text.
	- `Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Length`
		- Get `Get-ChildItem` retrieves the files as objects and the pipe send those objects to Sort-Object, which then sorts them by their length (size) property.
	- For example:
		- To list only txt files:
			`Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Extension" -eq ".txt"`
	- As we see the `-eq` operator, there are many other comparison operators as below:
		- `-ne`: not equal to
		- `-gt`: greater than
		- `-ge`: greater than or equal to
		- `-lt`: less than
		- `-le`: less than or equal to
	- `Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name,Length`
		- Gives the contents of the directory based on the `Select-Object` properties.
		- Useful to refine the output to show only the required details.
	- `Select-String`
		- Finds the given string within a file.
	- `Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property Length -gt 100`
		- Returns files with size greater than 100.
- System and Network Information
	- `Get-ComputerInfo`
		- Retrieves comprehensive system information including OS information, hardware specs, BIOS details, etc.
	- `Get-LocalUser`
		- Lists all local user accounts on the system.
	- `Get-NetIPConfiguration`
		- Provides the detailed information about network interfaces on the system.
		- Includes IP addresses, DNS servers, gateway configurations, etc.
		- Similar to ipconfig / ifconfig / ip a.
	- `Get-NetIPAddress`
		- Gives specific details of all IP addresses configured on the system.
		- Includes non-active IPs.
- Real-time system analysis
	- `Get-Process`: gives detailed view of all running processes.
		- GPU, memory usage, etc.
	- `Get-Service`: Gives services - running, stopped or paused.
		- Used by system administrators for troubleshooting.
		- Used by forensic analysts hunting for anomalous services installed on the system.
	- `Get-NetTCPConnection`: Displays current TCP connections.
		- Gives insight to both local and remote endpoints.
		- Handy during incident response or malware analysis task.
		- It can uncover hidden backdoors or established connections towards an attacker-controlled server.
	- `Get-FileHash`: Generates file hashes.
		- Useful during incident response, threat hunting, and malware analysis.
		- Get-FileHash -Path <Path_To_txt_File>
