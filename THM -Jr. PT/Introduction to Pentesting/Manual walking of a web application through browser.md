- **Viewing Page Source** - Important observations
	- There are various hidden pages
		- Home page is temporary with a new one in development.
		- Another hidden page at the bottom.
		- Directory listing was enabled due to which we can see the directory where static files are placed.
		- Also it might be good to know the versions of the frameworks, the website uses. It could be out of date and have public vulnerabilities.
- **Developer Tools** - Used to debug web applications.
	- Specifically three features of the DT:
		- Inspector: CSS, JS and other interactive blocks would change the way a website look and would make the look different from the only html one. Inspector lets us inspect the elements that what is happening under the website.
			- Paywalls: The pop ups that usually block the content of a website unless you pay for it.
			- We can change the CSS or other blocks where we can bypass paywalls.
				- In the lab website, go to inspector, click on the pop up html, look for display. If its not there, add your own. Now change the display as block to none and the pop up will disappear.
		- Debugger: Helps debug JS code.
			- Firefox / Safari : Debug
				- Chrome : Sources
		- Network: Keep track of all the external requests, a webpage make.
			- AJAX - A method to send or receive network data without change the contents of the page, such as filling and submitting a form.
