## CIA triad
- C : Confidentiality - Information / Data must not be accessible to unauthorized users.
- I : Integrity - Information / Data must be kept unchanged and consistent unless changed by authorized user.
- A : Availability - Information / Data must be available at every time to the authorized users.
## Principles of Privilege
The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:

- The individual's role/function within the organisation.
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system.
- Privilege Identity Management (PIM) is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system.
- Privilege Access Management (PAM) is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, among other things.
### Security Models
There are various models that are used to achieve the above triad.
1. **The Bell-La Padula model**
- **Assumptions**
	- Organizational hierarchical structure.
	- Responsibilities and roles of everyone are well defined.
- This model is fit for govt and military organizations where thorough background check of the person is already done. It makes the person already trustworthy.

| **Advantages**                                                                                   | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa) | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect. |
| Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.                        | The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation.                                                                |

2. **Biba Model**
- Applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) 
- Rule: "no write up, no read down".
- Subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level.
- The Biba model is used in organisations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job. They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc.

| **Advantages**                                                                                              | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This model is simple to implement.                                                                          | There will be many levels of access and objects. Things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.                                   |
| Resolves the limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity. | Often results in delays within a business. For example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model. |

**Threat Modelling and Incident Response**
- Reviewing, testing and improving the security protocols in an organization.
- It also includes the identification of likely threats and vulnerabilities.
- The threat modelling principles include:
	- Preparation
	- Identification
	- Mitigation
	- Review
- The process of threat modelling is complex and should include:
	- Threat intelligence
	- Asset identification
	- Mitigation capabilities
	- Risk assessment
- **Frameworks for Threat modelling**
	- PASTA : Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.
	- STRIDE : Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation thread, Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privileges.
		- By two Microsoft researchers in 1999.
		- Have six main principles as below:

|                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Principle**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Spoofing               | This principle requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.<br><br>Access keys (such as API keys) or signatures via encryption helps remediate this threat. |
| Tampering              | By providing anti-tampering measures to a system or application, you help provide integrity to the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.<br><br>For example, shops use seals on food products.                                      |
| Repudiation            | This principle dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Information Disclosure | Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner.                                                                                                        |
| Denial of Service      | Applications and services use up system resources, these two things should have measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down.                                                                    |
| Elevation of Privilege | This is the worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level i.e. an administrator. This scenario often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure.    |
- A breach of security is known as **incident**.
- To remedy and resolve the threats, the taken actions are called **incident response**.
- Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact.
	- Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced
	- Impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.

- The team to respond to incidents is called Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
- Six phases of incident response:

|                 |                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action**      | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
| Preparation     | Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?                                                             |
| Identification  | Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?                                                |
| Containment     | Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?                                        |
| Eradication     | Remove the active threat.                                                                                                                   |
| Recovery        | Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.                                                    |
| Lessons Learned | What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails. |
