- Content could be anything from files to webpages which are not meant to be publicly accessible.
- This content could be:
	- Pages
	- Portals intended for staff usage
	- Older versions of the website
	- Backup files
	- Configuration files
	- Administration panels, etc.
- Three ways to discover content:
	- Manually
	- Automated
	- Open Source INTelligence (OSINT)
- #### Manually
	- Robots.txt file:  Robots.txt file tells search engines that which pages should not be publicly available and shown in the search engines. It also helps to ban search engines from crawling the website.
	- Favicon: A small logo in the tab header to brand the website. It is with all the frameworks, sometimes left unchanged by the developers and could give us the version of the framework used.
		- https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database
		- A database in which we can check against the target's favicon and find which framework and version is being used.
		- Only for unchanged favicons.
		- We can download and check the hash of a given favicon as: 

		*curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum*
		
		- sitemap.xml: This file includes all the sources that are to be added and included to public acces. It is opposite of robots.txt.
		- http headers: Sometimes,the http headers provide with important information such as framework/server used and its version. Use the command below to find more:
		*curl http://ip -v*
		- Framework stack: After getting the framework used from either source such as http headers or favicon, etc, we can go to its documentation and release notes to research about any public vulnerabilities.
