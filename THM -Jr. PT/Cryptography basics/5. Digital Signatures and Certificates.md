#### Digital Signatures
- We use our signatures to authenticate ourselves in the real world.
- Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity of a digital message or document.
- In this context, digital signatures are not the image of signs on a document but for example, the SHA-SUM checks when downloading an ISO.
	- We can use public and private key for the above which is the simplest form of digital signature.
	- One can generate a hash using private key of the distributer of the file.
	- When we download the file, we can use the distributer's public key to generate the same hash and compare it to check if the file has beeen tempered.

- In many modern countries, digital and physical signatures have the same legal value.
- The term _digital signature_ is used to refer to signing a document using a private key or a certificate.
- This approach proves document integrity.
#### Certificates
- Certificates are an essential application of public key cryptography.
- Certificates are linked to digital signatures.
- For example: *HTTPS
	- To know if the client is really talking to the proper server, we use certificates to authenticate this identity.
- They have a chain of trust.
	- Starts with the root CA (Certificate Authority).
	- From install time, your device, operating system, and web browser automatically trust various root CAs.
	- Certificates are trusted only when the Root CAs say they trust the organisation that signed them.
		- So a certificate is signed by an organization.
		- The organization is trusted by CA.
		- The CA is trusted by our browser.
		- Thus the browser trusts the certificate.
		- Generally these chains of trust are long.
- For example, an HTTPS website would require a TLS certificate.
- These certificates might be available on an annual fee or free using *let's encrypt*.
