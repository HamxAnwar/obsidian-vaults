- **Cryptography**: Science of securing communication in the presence of adversaries.
- **Cryptanalysis**: How to break or bypass cryptographic systems.
- **Brute-Force attack**: Trying every possible combination of passwords.
- **Dictionary attack**: When we most likely know that the password is most likely a word in a list, it makes sense that we should try every wordin that dictionary insteadof every possible combination.
- We talked about:
	- Cryptography
	- Symmetric cryptography
	- Asymmetric cryptography
	- Key exchange
	- RSA
	- Diffie-Hellman
	- SSH key pairs
	- Digital signatures
	- Certificates
	- OpenGPG (PGP / GPG)
- **Hashing**
	- A process that takes input data and produces a hash value, a fixed-size string of characters, also referred to as digest.
	- Uniquely represents the data
		- Any change in the data, no matter how small, should lead to a change in the hash value.
	- Hashing should not be confused with encryption or encoding; hashing is one-way, and you canâ€™t reverse the process to get the original data.
- **Encoding**
	- Converts data from one form to another to make it compatible with a specific system.
	- ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ISO-8859-1, and Windows-1252 are valid encoding methods for the English language.
	- UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are Unicode encodings, and they can represent characters from other languages, such as Arabic and Japanese.
	- Another type of encoding commonly used when sending or saving data is not for any specific language.
		- For e.g. Base32 and Base64 encoding.
	- Encoding should not be confused with encryption.
	- Using a specific encoding does not protect the confidentiality of the message.
	- Encoding is reversible; anyone can change the data encoding with the right tools.
- **Encryption**
	- Protects data confidentiality using a cryptographic cipher and a key.
	- Encryption is reversible, provided we know the cipher and can access the key.
