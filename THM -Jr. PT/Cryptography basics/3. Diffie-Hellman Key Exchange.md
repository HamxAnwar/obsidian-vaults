- Key exchange aims to establish a shared secret between two parties.
	- Allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure communication channel.
	- Doesn't require a pre-existing shared secret.
	- No observer being able to get this key.
	- Shared secret can be used for symmetric encryption.
- **Scenario**
	- Alice and Bob wants to talk securely.
	- They want to establish a shared key for symmetric cryptography.
	- Don't want to use the asymmetric cryptography for key exchange.
	- They can *use* the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**.
	- **Process**
		- Alice and Bob agree on the public variables.
			- A large price number *p*
				- Here *p* = 29
			- A generator *g*
				- Here *g* = 3
			- Such that *0* < *g* < *p*
			- These values are publicly disclosed over the communication channel.
		- Each party chooses a private integer.
			- Alice: *a* = 13
			- Bob: *b* = 15
			- Each of above represents a private key and should not be disclosed.
			- Each party calculates their public key using their private key and public variables.
				- Alice: $$ A = g^a mod p $$ $$ 3^{13} mod 29 = 19 $$
				- Bob: $$ B = g^b mod p $$ $$ 3^{15} mod 29 = 26 $$
				- These are the public keys.
			- Alice and Bob send the keys to eachother.
				- Bob receives 19.
				- Alice receives 26.
				- This step is called *key exchange*
			- Alice and Bob can calculate the shared secret using the received public key as well as their own private key.
				- Alice: $$ B^a mod p = 26^{13} mod 29 = 10 $$
				- Bob: $$ A^b mod p = 19^{15} mod 29 = 10 $$

	- The chosen numbers in real life and much larger.
	- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is often used alongside RSA public key cryptography.
	- Diffie-Hellman for key agreement while RSA for digital signature, key transport, authentication, etc.
	- RSA helps prove the identity of the person we are talking to via digital signing using the public key.
	- Prevents MITM attacks.
