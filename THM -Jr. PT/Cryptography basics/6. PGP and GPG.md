- *PGP* = *Pretty Good Privacy*
	- It's software to implement encryption for encrypting files, performing digital signing, etc.
- *GnuPG* or *GPG* is an open-source implementation of OpenPGP standard.
	- GPG is commonly used in emails to protect the confidentiality of the messages.
	- It can also be used to sign email messages and confirm its integrity.
- When *generating a GPG*:
	- Asked if the GPG is for signing only or signing and encrypting.
	- Select cryptography algorithm
	- Select the expiration date for the generated key.
	- Provide information about us:
		- Name
		- Email address
		- A comment usually about the purpose of the key.

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

- We may also need GPG to decrypt files in CTFs.
- With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected using a passphrase similar to the SSH private keys.
- To crack, we can use the tools:
	- John the Ripper
	- gpg2john
- Letâ€™s say we got a new computer. All we need to do is import our key, and we can start decrypting our received messages again:
	- We would use `gpg --import backup.key` to import our key from backup.key
	- To decrypt our messages, we need to issue `gpg --decrypt confidential_message.gpg`
