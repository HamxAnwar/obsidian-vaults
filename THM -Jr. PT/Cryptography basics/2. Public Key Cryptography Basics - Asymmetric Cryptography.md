- **Authentication**: You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.
- **Authenticity**: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.
- **Integrity**: You must ensure that no one changes the data you exchange.
- **Confidentiality**: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.
- Cryptography can provide solutions to the above problems.
	- Private key cryptography (Symmetric cryptography) mainly protects confidentiality.
	- Public key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography) plays a significant role in authentication, authenticity, and integrity.
#### Common Uses
- The exchange of keys from symmetric cryptography is a widely used case of asymmetric cryptography.
- Assymetric encryptions are slower than symmetric encryptions.
	- We rely on asymmetric encryption to negotiate and agree on symmetric encryption ciphers and keys.
- We would only need to use asymmetric cryptography once so that it wonâ€™t affect the speed, and then you can communicate privately using symmetric encryption.
#### RSA
- A public key encryption algorithm.
- On an insecure channel, we expect an adversiary to eavesdrop over the channel.
	- RSA lets secure data transmission over insecure channels.
- Based on a mathematical problem of factoring a large number.
	- Takes alot of computing power.
	- A cmpute can easily factorize 166764499494295486767649.
	- In real world, the number got to be much more bigger than the above.
	- *Cannot factorize numbers greater than 600 digits.*
- **Example**
	- *Public key* is known to all correspondants and used for encryption.
	- *Private key* is used for decryption.
		- Protected key.
	- Based on *prime numbers*
		- Product of two prime numbers is only divisible by itself, the numbers and one.
		- For a product of very large prime numbers, we need to guess too many possibilities so larger computation required.
	- We can view this in firefox in a certificate that we use.

	1. Let *p* and *q* are large prime numbers.
	2. $$ n = p x q $$
	3. $$ r = (p - 1) (q - 1) $$
	4. $$ e = (3, 5, 17, 65537) $$
	5. $$ d = e^{-1} mod(r) $$
	6. So our *public key* = *(e,n)*
	7. Our *private key* = *(d)*
	8. If
		- m = message
		- c = ciphertext
		- To encrypt $$ m^{e} mod(n) $$
		- To decrypt $$ c^{d} mod(n) $$
	- **Example**
		-  p = 11
		- q = 3
		- n = p x q = 33
		- r = (p - 1)(q - 1) = 20
		- e = 3 (Selected from earlier options)
		- d = 7
		- **mesage = 7**
		- 7^3  mod 33 = 13 (encrypted ciphertext)
		- 13^7 mod 33 = 7 (decrypted plain text)
