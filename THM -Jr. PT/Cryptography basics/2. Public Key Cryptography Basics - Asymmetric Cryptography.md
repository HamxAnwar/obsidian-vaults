- **Authentication**: You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.
- **Authenticity**: You can verify that the information comes from the claimed source.
- **Integrity**: You must ensure that no one changes the data you exchange.
- **Confidentiality**: You want to prevent an unauthorised party from eavesdropping on your conversations.
- Cryptography can provide solutions to the above problems.
	- Private key cryptography (Symmetric cryptography) mainly protects confidentiality.
	- Public key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography) plays a significant role in authentication, authenticity, and integrity.
#### Common Uses
- The exchange of keys from symmetric cryptography is a widely used case of asymmetric cryptography.
- Assymetric encryptions are slower than symmetric encryptions.
	- We rely on asymmetric encryption to negotiate and agree on symmetric encryption ciphers and keys.
- We would only need to use asymmetric cryptography once so that it wonâ€™t affect the speed, and then you can communicate privately using symmetric encryption.
#### RSA
- On an insecure channel, we expect an adversiary to eavesdrop over the channel.
	- RSA is a public key encryption technique that lets secure data transmission over insecure channels.
