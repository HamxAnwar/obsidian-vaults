- SSH also worked with public and private keys.
- By default, SSH keys are RSA keys.
	- We can choose algorithms to generate them, for example ED25519 algorithm.
- While connecting to a server for first time using SSH, it asked if we trust the public key.
- Mostly used program to generate keys are ssh-keygen.
	- **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)** is a public-key cryptography algorithm specifically designed for digital signatures.
	- **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** is a variant of DSA that uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide smaller key sizes for equivalent security.
	- **ECDSA-SK (ECDSA with Security Key)** is an extension of ECDSA. It incorporates hardware-based security keys for enhanced private key protection.
	- **Ed25519** is a public-key signature system using EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with Curve25519.
	- **Ed25519-SK (Ed25519 with Security Key)** is a variant of Ed25519. Similar to ECDSA-SK, it uses a hardware-based security key for improved private key protection.
- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
	- Generated two files:
		- id_ed25519 : Private key
		- id_ed25519.pub : Public key
	- Note: Using `-t RSA` would result in longer keys.
- Mostly, to make it more secure, the private key is encrypted with a passphrase.
- This passphrase doesn't identify us to the server but only decrypts the SSH private key.
	- The passphrase is neither transmitted nor leaves our system.
	- We can use tools, such as John The Ripper, to attack the encrypted SSH key to find the passphrase.
- When a public key is shared, the authorized public keys are stored under `~/.ssh` in the `authorized_keys file`
- **Note:** During CTFs, penetration testing, and red teaming exercises, SSH keys are an excellent way to “upgrade” a reverse shell, assuming the user has login enabled. Note that www-data usually does not allow this, but regular users and root will work. Leaving an SSH key in the `authorized_keys` file on a machine can be a useful backdoor, and you don’t need to deal with any of the issues of unstabilised reverse shells like Control-C or lack of tab completion.
