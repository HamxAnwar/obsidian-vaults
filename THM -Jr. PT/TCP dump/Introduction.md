The main challenge when studying networking protocols is that we don’t get a chance to see the protocol “conversations” taking place. All the technical complexities are hidden behind friendly and elegant user interfaces. You access resources on your local network without ever seeing an ARP query. Similarly, you would access Internet services for years without seeing a single three-way handshake till you check a networking book or inspect a network traffic capture. The best study aid would be capturing network traffic and taking a closer look at the various protocols; this helps us better understand how networks work.

This folder introduces:
- Some basic command-line arguments for using Tcpdump.
- The Tcpdump tool and its `libpcap` library are written in C and C++ and were released for Unix-like systems in the late 1980s or early 1990s.
- Very stable and offer optimal speed.
- The `libpcap` library is the foundation for various other networking tools today.
- Ported to MS Windows as `winpcap`.
